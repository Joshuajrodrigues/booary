Booary

Booary is a web component designed to display a reading history in the style of a vintage library card. It uses a JSON file as a database and supports yearly archiving and friend cross-referencing.
Usage
1. Installation

Include the library via CDN in your HTML or Astro project:
HTML

<script src="https://unpkg.com/booary"></script>

2. Implementation

Place the custom element in your code. It requires a link to your local data and can optionally accept an array of friend URLs.
HTML

<x-library-card 
  cardlink="/library/card.json" 
  friends='["https://friend-site.com/library/card.json"]'>
</x-library-card>

The CLI

The package includes a command-line interface to manage your library without manual JSON editing.

To run the CLI:
Bash

pnpm booary

Functionality:

    Initialization: Configures your borrower name and library name on the first run.

    Book Search: Queries the Open Library API to find book details.

    Automatic Archiving: New books are filed under the current year. If a year does not exist in your history, the CLI creates it.

Features

    Yearly Navigation: Toggle between different years using the navigation arrows to view historical reading data.

    Social Discovery: If a friend in your list has read the same book in the same year, their librarian signature will appear next to that book on your card.

    Encapsulated Design: Built as a standard Web Component that works across all modern browsers and frameworks.

Data Structure

The card.json file is organized by years to allow for historical browsing.
